# Blockchain with Python


This Python/steamlit application is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

The application works by building basic PyChain ledger structure and Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application collecting the relevant information for each financial record that youâ€™ll store in the PyChain ledger.
